    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> I am an innovator. I have worked with amazing individuals in the financial industry for 10 years and have led numerous  projects promoting innovation and process improvement. Growth whether of people or business in general is my passion, bringing new perspective and inspiring individuals to think outside the box. I have also ventured in the freelancing world for the last 2 years catering to SMM and VA tasks. I am adept at Data Analytics, allowing me to create sustainable solutions suitable for the business. My spare time is spent around creative inputs -- crypto, producing digital arts on my iPad or going back to basic with a trusty charcoal. I am an ambitious professional with a heart, balancing business progress and uplifting people. If that's what your company is aiming for, I can help you make your vision a reality.</p>
